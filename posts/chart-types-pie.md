# Pie Charts: Part-to-Whole Relationships

Pie charts show how different parts make up a whole, making them useful for displaying proportions and percentages.

## When to Use Pie Charts

Pie charts work best when:
- Showing parts of a whole
- Displaying percentages
- Comparing proportions
- Working with small datasets

## Example Data
<ChartSwitcher 
  data={[
    { name: "Hungarian", value: 82 },
    { name: "Romanian", value: 15 },
    { name: "Other", value: 3 }
  ]}
  defaultType="pie"
